You installed workerd on another platform than the one you're currently using.
This won't work because workerd is written with native code and needs to
install a platform-specific binary executable.

Specifically the "${otherPkg}" package is present but this platform
needs the "${pkg}" package instead. People often get into this
situation by installing workerd on macOS and copying "node_modules"
into a Docker image that runs Linux.

If you are installing with npm, you can try not copying the "node_modules"
directory when you copy the files over, and running "npm ci" or "npm install"
on the destination platform after the copy. Or you could consider using yarn
instead which has built-in support for installing a package on multiple
platforms simultaneously.

If you are installing with yarn, you can try listing both this platform and the
other platform in your ".yarnrc.yml" file using the "supportedArchitectures"
feature: https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc/#supportedArchitectures
Keep in mind that this means multiple copies of workerd will be present.

        // case at all.

        // what's happening. Otherwise we just rethrow the original error message.

If you are installing workerd with npm, make sure that you don't specify the
"--no-optional" flag. The "optionalDependencies" package.json feature is used
by workerd to install the correct binary executable for your current platform.`);

  // the real file system.
  //
  // You might think that we could use "preferUnplugged: true" in each of the
  // platform-specific packages for this instead, since that tells Yarn to not
  // use the virtual file system for those packages. This is not done because:
  //
  // * Really early versions of Yarn don't support "preferUnplugged", so package
  //   installation would break on those Yarn versions if we did this.
  //
  // * Earlier Yarn versions always installed all optional dependencies for all
  //   platforms even though most of them are incompatible. To minimize file
  //   system space, we want these useless packages to take up as little space
  //   as possible so they should remain unzipped inside their ".zip" files.
  //
  //   We have to explicitly pass "preferUnplugged: false" instead of leaving
  //   it up to Yarn's default behavior because Yarn's heuristics otherwise
  //   automatically unzip packages containing ".exe" files, and we don't want
  //   our Windows-specific packages to be unzipped either.
