# V8 Updates

To update the version of V8 used by workerd, the steps are:

1. Check <https://omahaproxy.appspot.com/> and identify the latest version of V8 used by the beta versions of Chrome beta.

2. Install depot_tools if it is not already present on your machine.

3. Fetch a local copy of V8:

   ```sh
   mkdir v8
   cd v8
   fetch v8
   ```

4. Sync the local copy of V8 to the version used by workerd.

   First find, the tag of the "v8" `http_archive` in the workerd [WORKSPACE](../WORKSPACE) file.

   Then sync your fetched version v8 based on the tag.

   ```sh
   cd v8/v8
   git checkout <tag>
   gclient sync
   ```

5. Create a V8 branch for workerd's V8 patches in your local copy of V8.

   ```sh
   git checkout -b workerd-patches
   git am <path_to_workerd>/patches/v8/*
   ```

6. Rebase the workerd V8 changes onto the new version of V8. For example, assuming
   we are updating to 11.4.183.8 and there are 8 workerd patches for V8, the
   command would be:

   ```sh
   git rebase --onto 11.4.183.8 HEAD~8
   ```

   There is usually some minor patch editing required during a rebase.

   Ideally at this stage, you should be able to build and test the local V8 with the
   patches applied. See the V8 [Testing](https://v8.dev/docs/test) page.

7. Re-generate workerd's V8 patches. Assuming there are 8 workerd patches for V8,
   the command would be:

   ```sh
   git format-patch --full-index -k --no-signature HEAD~8
   ```

8. Remove the existing patches from `workerd/patches/v8` and copy the latest patches
   for the V8 directory there.

9. Update the `http_archive` for V8 in the `workerd/WORKSPACE` file.

    The list of patches should be refreshed if new patches are being added or existing
    patches are being removed.

    `strip_prefix` and `url` in the `http_archive` for V8 should be updated based on the new V8
    version/tag.

    See [V8 http_archive in WORKSPACE](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/blob/587ad90dd1e91d2660c271018056f4189fca3501/WORKSPACE#L408)

10. Update V8's dependencies in `workerd/WORKSPACE`.

    The `v8/.gclient_entries` file contains the commit versions for V8's dependencies.

    You can find V8's dependencies that are carried through to workerd in the `WORKSPACE` file.

    You will usually update `com_google_chromium_icu`, but other projects may need updating
    too. Typically you'll get a build failure if the projects are out of sync. Copy the
    commit versions from `v8/.gclient_entries` to the `WORKSPACE` file.

11. Check workerd's tests pass with the updated V8.

     ```sh
     bazel test //...
     ```

12. Commit your workerd changes and push them for review.
