## Updating V8 in workerd

V8 updates are high-risk changes that require careful patch management and human judgment for merge conflicts. This skill covers the full process. **Always confirm the target version with the developer before starting.**

See also: `docs/v8-updates.md` for the original reference document.

---

### Prerequisites

- `depot_tools` installed and on `$PATH` ([setup guide](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up))
- A local V8 checkout (outside the workerd repo to avoid confusing Bazel):
  ```sh
  mkdir v8 && cd v8 && fetch v8
  ```

---

### Step 1: Identify the target version

Check [chromiumdash.appspot.com](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/) for the latest V8 version used by Chrome Beta. Confirm the target `<new_version>` with the developer.

Find the current version in `build/deps/v8.MODULE.bazel`:

```
VERSION = "14.5.201.6"    # example — check the actual file
```

We'll call this `<old_version>`.

### Step 2: Sync local V8 to the current workerd version

```sh
cd <path_to_v8>/v8
git checkout <old_version>
gclient sync
```

### Step 3: Apply workerd's patches onto a branch

```sh
git checkout -b workerd-patches
git am <path_to_workerd>/patches/v8/*
```

There are multiple patches in `patches/v8/`. These include workerd-specific customizations:

| Patch category  | Examples                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Serialization   | Custom ValueSerializer/Deserializer format versions, proxy/function host object support               |
| Build system    | Windows/Bazel fixes, shared linkage, dependency path overrides (fp16, fast_float, simdutf, dragonbox) |
| Embedder hooks  | Promise context tagging, cross-request promise resolution, extra isolate embedder slot                |
| Bug workarounds | Memory leak assert disable, slow handle check disable, builtin-can-allocate workaround                |
| API additions   | `String::IsFlat`, `AdjustAmountOfExternalAllocatedMemory` exposure, additional Exception constructors |
| ICU/config      | ICU data export, googlesource ICU binding, verify_write_barriers flag                                 |

### Step 4: Rebase patches onto the new V8 version

```sh
git rebase --onto <new_version> <old_version>
```

**This is where most of the work happens.** Expect conflicts. Key guidance:

- **Build-system patches** (dependency paths, Bazel config) conflict most often as upstream V8 restructures its build.
- **API patches** (new methods on V8 classes) may conflict if upstream changed the surrounding code.
- **Always preserve workerd's intent** — understand what each patch does before resolving conflicts. The patch filenames are descriptive.
- **Do not drop patches** without explicit confirmation from the developer.
- **Do not auto-resolve conflicts** — flag them for human review. Merge conflicts in V8 patches almost always require human judgment.

After rebasing, ideally build and test V8 standalone to verify patches apply cleanly. See the V8 [Testing](https://v8.dev/docs/test) page.

### Step 5: Regenerate patches

```sh
git format-patch --full-index -k --no-signature --no-stat --zero-commit <new_version>
```

This produces numbered `.patch` files in the current directory.

### Step 6: Replace patches in workerd

```sh
rm <path_to_workerd>/patches/v8/*
cp *.patch <path_to_workerd>/patches/v8/
```

### Step 7: Update `build/deps/v8.MODULE.bazel`

Three things need updating:

1. **`VERSION`**: Set to `<new_version>`.

2. **`INTEGRITY`**: Compute the sha256 hash of the new tarball:

   ```sh
   curl -sL "https://github.com/v8/v8/archive/refs/tags/<new_version>.tar.gz" -o v8.tar.gz
   openssl dgst -sha256 -binary v8.tar.gz | openssl base64 -A
   ```

   Format: `"sha256-<base64_hash>="`. Alternatively, attempt a build and copy the expected hash from Bazel's mismatch error.

3. **`PATCHES`**: Update the list if patches were added, removed, or renamed. The list must match the filenames in `patches/v8/` exactly, in order.

### Step 8: Update V8's dependencies

V8 depends on several libraries that are pinned in `build/deps/v8.MODULE.bazel` and `build/deps/deps.jsonc`. Check the local V8 checkout's `DEPS` file for commit versions:

```sh
cat <path_to_v8>/v8/DEPS
```

Dependencies to check and update:

| Dependency                      | Where                                      | Notes                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `com_googlesource_chromium_icu` | `v8.MODULE.bazel` (git_repository commit)  | Chromium fork; update commit from V8's DEPS                    |
| `perfetto`                      | `deps.jsonc` (managed by `update-deps.py`) | V8 depends via Chromium; safe to bump to latest GitHub release |
| `simdutf`                       | `deps.jsonc` (managed by `update-deps.py`) | V8 depends via Chromium; safe to bump to latest GitHub release |

For dependencies in `deps.jsonc`, you can use the update script:

```sh
python3 build/deps/update-deps.py perfetto
python3 build/deps/update-deps.py simdutf
```

This fetches the latest version, computes integrity hashes, and regenerates the `gen/` MODULE.bazel fragments. **Do not hand-edit files in `build/deps/gen/`.**

### Step 9: Build and test

```sh
# Full build
just build

# Full test suite
just test
```

Watch for:

- **Build failures from V8 API changes**: V8 may deprecate or change APIs between versions. Search for deprecation warnings in the build output. Common areas affected:
  - `src/workerd/jsg/` — V8 binding layer, most directly affected
  - `src/workerd/api/` — APIs that interact with V8 types directly
  - `src/workerd/io/worker.c++` — Isolate creation and configuration

- **Test failures from behavior changes**: V8 may change observable JS behavior. Check:
  - `just test //src/workerd/jsg/...` — JSG binding tests
  - `just test //src/workerd/api/tests/...` — API tests
  - Node.js compatibility tests (`just node-test`)
  - Web Platform Tests (`just wpt-test`)

- **New V8 deprecation warnings**: These are future breakage signals. Document them in the PR description even if tests pass.

### Step 10: Commit and submit

Commit the changes and push for review. The PR should include:

- Updated `build/deps/v8.MODULE.bazel` (version, integrity, patches list)
- Updated patches in `patches/v8/`
- Updated dependency versions if changed
- Any C++ fixes for V8 API changes
- PR description listing: old version, new version, patches that required conflict resolution, any deprecation warnings observed, and any behavior changes noted

### Troubleshooting

**Bazel integrity mismatch**: If you see `expected sha256-... but got sha256-...`, copy the "got" hash into the `INTEGRITY` field. This happens when the hash was computed incorrectly or the tarball was re-generated by GitHub.

**Patch won't apply**: A patch that applied cleanly during `git am` but fails in Bazel means the `git format-patch` output differs from what Bazel expects. Verify you used `--full-index -k --no-signature --no-stat --zero-commit` flags. Also verify patch order matches the `PATCHES` list.

**ICU build failures**: ICU is a Chromium fork fetched via `git_repository`. If the commit in `v8.MODULE.bazel` is wrong, you'll see missing-file or compilation errors in ICU. Cross-reference with V8's `DEPS` file for the correct commit.

**`update-deps.py` fails**: The script requires network access to fetch versions. If a dependency's GitHub release format changed, you may need to update the version manually in `deps.jsonc` and run `python3 build/deps/update-deps.py` to regenerate hashes.
