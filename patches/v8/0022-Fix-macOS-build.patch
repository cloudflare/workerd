Subject: Fix macOS build

In V8 13.3, absl/synchronization is used on macOS, which was not reflected in
the Bazel build. Also remove the (unused) absl_optional dependency so we can
drop the binding for it.
In 13.4, absl/synchronization is used across platforms and declared in the
Bazel build, absl_optional has been removed and with the switch to bzlmod absl
and hwy bindings as a whole are no longer needed; this patch can be dropped.
