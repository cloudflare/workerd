Subject: Fix V8/ICU build

1) ICU changed how a header is included, but V8's bazel build file has not been
   updated to make the header available.
2) Bazel's V8 build will use abseil in the near future. While it is
   already added as a dependency, it is not actually required yet, so
   do not include it for now. In a future version, we can use our
   existing absl dependency, we'll just need to keep it in sync with
   V8's version.
