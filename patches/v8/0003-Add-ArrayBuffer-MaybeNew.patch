Subject: Add `ArrayBuffer::MaybeNew()`.

In Cloudflare's edge runtime, this is part of a larger patch that allows graceful handling of allocations that exceed memory limits. `workerd` currently doesn't enforce any limits, so to reduce complexity we just forward to `New()`.

(We would like to upstream our internal patch, just need to find the time...)
