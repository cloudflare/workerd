# Releasing `workerd` and `workers-types` to NPM

The primary distribution channel for `workerd` right now is through `npm`. We use a (mostly) automatic CI setup to release and publish both `workerd` and `workers-types`.

## Versioning

`workerd` and `workers-types` follow the same versioning system. The major version is currently `1` for `workerd` and `4` for `workers-types`. The minor version for both is the compatibility date specified in [compatibility-date.capnp](src/workerd/io/compatibility-date.capnp) (the latest compatibility date that the `workerd` release will support).


## Releases

This is pretty simple, and completely automatic—every time the compatibility date in [compatibility-date.capnp](src/workerd/io/compatibility-date.capnp) changes, a new release is generated, along with the built binaries for `linux-64` and `darwin-64`. This is governed by the [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) GitHub Action. Since this only generates binaries for `darwin-64` and `linux-64`, binaries for `darwin-arm64` and `linux-arm64` need to be built manually on local machines. The generated GitHub release should be edited, with the built binaries uploaded as extra assets (named `workerd-darwin-arm64` and `workerd-linux-arm64` respectively).
## Publishing `workerd`

Since the "Release" stage requires manual upload of binaries, this "Publish" stage requires a manual run of a GitHub Action—the [Publish to NPM](.github/workflows/npm.yml) action. This action has a `workflow_dispatch` trigger that can be activated from within the GitHub UI, and takes two parameters; the patch version, and whether this release is a prerelease. If it _is_ a prerelease, the published NPM version will be tagged with `beta`, and have a version number starting with `0.`. Otherwise, the published NPM version will be tagged `latest`, and have a version number starting with `1.`.

## Publishing `workers-types`

This also requires a manual run of a GitHub Action—the [Publish types to NPM](.github/workflows/npm-types.yml) action. This action has a `workflow_dispatch` trigger that can be activated from within the GitHub UI, and takes two parameters; the patch version, and whether this is a prerelease. If it _is_ a prerelease, the published NPM version will be tagged with `beta`, and have a version number starting with `0.`. Otherwise, the published NPM version will be tagged `latest`, and have a version number starting with `4.`.
