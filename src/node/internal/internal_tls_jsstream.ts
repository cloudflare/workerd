/* This class serves as a wrapper for when the C++ side of Node wants access
 * to a standard JS stream. For example, TLS or HTTP do not operate on network
 * resources conceptually, although that is the common case and what we are
 * optimizing for; in theory, they are completely composable and can work with
 * any stream resource they see.
 *
 * For the common case, i.e. a TLS socket wrapping around a net.Socket, we
 * can skip going through the JS layer and let TLS access the raw C++ handle
 * of a net.Socket. The flipside of this is that, to maintain composability,
 * we need a way to create "fake" net.Socket instances that call back into a
 * "real" JavaScript stream. JSStreamSocket is exactly this.
