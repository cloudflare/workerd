// A ReadableSource is primarily intended to serve as a bridge between kj::AsyncInputStream
// and the ReadableStream API. However, it can also be used directly by KJ-space code that needs
// deferred proxying. While ReadableSource should probably have been a more JS-friendly
// API, it's a bit too late to change that now. Use the ReadableSourceJsAdapter in the
// readable-source-adapter.h file to wrap a ReadableSource for use from JavaScript.
//
// A ReadableSource must be treated like a KJ I/O object. Instances that are held
// by any JS-heap objects must be held by an IoOwn.
//
// If the ReadableSource is canceled or dropped, all pending read() reads will be
// canceled.
//
// Only one read() may be pending at a time. Attempting to initiate a second read()
// while one is already pending will result in a rejected promise.
//
// Calling pumpTo initiates a sequence of read() calls until the stream is fully consumed.
// Ownership of the underlying AsyncInputStream is transferred to the pumpTo operation and
// the ReadableSource is put into a closed state. After calling pumpTo, no further
// read() calls may be made directly on the ReadableSource. Dropping the returned
// promise before it resolves will cancel the pump operation.
//
// It is **NOT** intended that you should implement this interface for general use.
// It is only intended to be implemented by specific classes within workerd for the
// purpose of bridging between kj/js streams. Streams that operate at the kj level
// should implement the kj::Async*Stream interfaces, and streams that operate at
// the JS level should implement to the UnderlyingSource interface. This is a
// departure from what we've done previously but as part of the effort to simplify
// the streams code, the goal is to reduce the number of different stream interfaces
// that we implement to.
