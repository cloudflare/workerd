      // `KJ_CO_MAGIC` constitutes the second async flow that actually handles the request and
      // response.
      //
      // Weird: It's important that these objects be torn down in the right order and that the
      // DeferredProxy promise is handled separately from the inner promise.
      //
      // Moreover, there is an interesting property: In the event that `httpClient` is destroyed
      // immediately after `bodyStream` (i.e. without returning to the KJ event loop in between),
      // and the body is chunked, then the connection will be closed before the terminating chunk
      // can be written. This is actually convenient as it allows us to make sure that when we
      // bail out due to an error, the cache is able to see that the request was incomplete and
      // should therefore not commit the cache entry.
      //
      // This is a bit of an accident. It would be much better if KJ's AsyncOutputStream had an
      // explicit `end()` method to indicate all data had been written successfully, rather than
      // just assume so in the destructor. But, that's a major refactor, and it's immediately
      // important to us that we don't write incomplete cache entries, so we rely on this hack for
      // now. See EW-812 for the broader problem.
      //
      // A little funky: The process of "serializing" the cache entry payload means reading all the
      // data from the payload body stream and writing it to cache. But, the payload body might
      // originate from the app's own JavaScript, rather than being the response to some remote
      // request. If the stream is JS-backed, then we want to be careful to track "pending events".
      // Specifically, if the stream hasn't reported EOF yet, but JavaScript stops executing and
      // there is no external I/O that we're waiting for, then we know that the stream will never
      // end, and we want to cancel out the IoContext proactively.
      //
      // If we were to use `context.awaitIo(serializePromise)` here, we'd lose this property,
      // because the context would believe that waiting for the stream itself constituted I/O, even
      // if the stream is backed by JS.
      //
      // On the other hand, once the serialization step completes, we need to wait for the cache
      // backend to respond. At that point, we *are* awaiting I/O, and want to record that
      // correctly.
      //
      // So basically, we have an asynchorous promise we need to wait for, and for the first part
      // of that wait, we don't want to count it as pending I/O, but for the second part, we do.
      // How do we accomplish this?
      //
      // Well, it just so happens that `serializePromise` is a special kind of promise that might
      // help us -- it's kj::Promise<DeferredProxy<void>>, a deferred proxy stream promise. This
      // is a promise-for-a-promise, with an interesting property: the outer promise is used to
      // wait for JavaScript-backed stream events, while the inner promise represents pure external
      // I/O. The method context.awaitDeferredProxy() awaits this special kind of promise, and it
      // already only counts the inner promise as being external pending I/O.
      //
      // However, we have some additional work we want to do *after* serializePromise (both parts)
      // completes -- additional work that is also external I/O. So how do we handle that? Well...
      // we can actually append it to `serializePromise`'s inner promise! Then awaitDeferredProxy()
      // will properly treat it as pending I/O, but only *after* the outer promise completes. This
      // gets us everything we want.
      //
      // Hence, what you see here: we first await the serializePromise, then enter deferred proxying
      // with our magic `KJ_CO_MAGIC`, then perform all our additional work. Then we
