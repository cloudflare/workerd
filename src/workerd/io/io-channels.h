class IoChannelFactory {
  // Each IoContext has a set of "channels" on which outgoing I/O can be initiated. All outgoing
  // I/O occurs through these channels. Think of these kind of like file descriptors. They are
  // often associated with bindings.
  //
  // For example, any call to fetch() uses a subrequest channel. The global fetch() specifically
  // uses subrequest channel zero. Each service binding (aka worker-to-worker binding) is assigned
  // a unique subrequest channel number, and calling `binding.fetch()` sends the request to the
  // given channel.
  //
  // While most channels are SubrequestChannels, other channel types exit to handle I/O that is
  // not subrequest-shaped. For example, a Workers Analytics Engine binding uses a logging channel.
  //
  // Note that each type of channel has its own number space. That is, subrequest channel 5 and
  // logging channel 5 are not related.
  //
  // The reason we have channels, rather than binding API objects directly holding the I/O objects,
  // is because binding API objects live across multiple requests, but the I/O objects may differ
  // from request to request.
  //
  // This class encapsulates all outgoing I/O that a Worker can perform. It does not cover incoming
  // I/O, i.e. the event that started the Worker. If IoChannelFactory is implemented such that
  // all methods throw exceptions, then the Worker will be completely unable to communicate with
