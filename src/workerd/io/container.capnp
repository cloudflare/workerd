  # RPC interface to talk to a container, for containers attached to Durable Objects.

  # When the actor shuts down, workerd will drop the `Container` capability, at which point
  # the container engine should implicitly destroy the container.

  status @0 () -> (running :Bool);
  # Returns the container's current status. The runtime will always call this at DO startup.

  start @1 StartParams -> ();
  # Start the container. It's an error to call this if the container is already running.

  struct StartParams {
    entrypoint @0 :List(Text);
    # Specifies the command to run as the root process of the container. If null, the container
    # image's default command is used.

    enableInternet @1 :Bool = false;
    # Set true to enable the container to talk directly to the public internet. Otherwise, the
    # public internet will not be accessible -- but it's still possible to intercept connection
    # attempts and handle them in the DO, using the `listenTcp()` method below.

    environmentVariables @2 :List(Text);
    # Specifies the environment variables of the container.
    # It will spread over the existing defined environment variables of the container image.
    # If null, the container will start with the environment variables defined in its image.
    # The format is defined as a list of `NAME=VALUE`.
    # The container runtime should validate the environment variables input.

  monitor @2 ();
  # Waits for the container to shut down.
  #
  # If the container shuts down because the root process exited with a success status, or because
  # the client invoked `destroy()`, then `monitor()` completes without an error. If it shuts down
  # for any other reason, `monitor()` throws an exception describing what happened. (This exception
  # may or may not be a JSG exception depending on whether it is an application error or a system
  # error.)

  destroy @3 ();
  # Immediately and abruptly stops the container and tears it down. The application is not given
  # any warning, it simply stops immediately. Upon successful return from destroy(), the container
  # is no longer running. If a call to `monitor()` is waiting when `destroy()` is invoked,
  # `monitor()` will also return (with no error). If the container is not running when `destroy()`
  # is invoked, `destroy()` silently returns with no error.

  signal @4 (signo :UInt32);
  # Sends the given Linux signal number to the root process.

  # Obtains an object which can be used to connect to the application inside the container on the
  # given TCP port (the application must be listening on this port).

  interface Port {
    # Represents a port to which connections can be made.

    connect @0 (down :ByteStream) -> (up :ByteStream);
    # Forms a raw socket connection to the port.
    #
    # Note that when the Durable Object application uses the HTTP-oriented APIs, workerd will
    # take care of speaking the HTTP protocol on top of the raw socket. So, the container engine
    # need only implement raw connections.
  }

  listenTcp @6 (filter :IpFilter, handler :TcpHandler) -> (handle :Capability);
  # Arranges to intercept outgoing TCP connections from the container and redirect them to the
  # given `handler`.

  struct IpFilter {
    # Specifies a range of IP addresses and/or port numbers which should be intercepted when the
    # application in the container tries to connect to them.

    # Interface which intercepts outgoing connections from a container.

    connect @0 (addr :Text, port :UInt16, down :ByteStream) -> (up :ByteStream);

    # attempting to connect.
