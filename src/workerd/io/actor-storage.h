  // and other metadata, such as the length of a string or number of items in an
  // array. The most important cases (where users are most likely to try to
  // intentionally run right up against the limit) are Strings and ArrayBuffers,
  // which each get 4 bytes of metadata attached when encoded. We throw a little
  // extra on just for future proofing and an abundance of caution.
  //
  // If you're curious why we add 34 bytes of cushion -- we used to add 32, but
  // then started writing v8 serialization headers, which are 2 bytes, and didn't
  // want to stop accepting values that we accepted before writing headers.
