// An I/O gate allows someone to "lock" a type of I/O so that other concurrent tasks trying to
// perform that type of I/O are blocked until the lock is released.
//
// I/O gates are used in actors to implement consistency guarantees, allowing in-memory state and
// storage to be synchronized.
//
// Each Actor has two main gates:
// - Input gate: While locked, blocks all incoming I/O events of any type from being delivered to
//   the actor, other than the specific event or events that hold the lock. This includes
//   blocking responses to subrequests, timer events, input streams, etc. Used when storage
//   operations are outstanding, so that awaiting a storage operation does not risk allowing
//   concurrent events that render the state inconsistent.
// - Output gate: While locked, blocks all outgoing messages from an actor that would allow the
//   rest of the world to observe the actor's state. Held while writes that have been confirmed
//   to the application are still being flushed to disk. If the flush fails, these messages will
//   never be sent, so that the rest of the world cannot observe a prematurely-confirmed write.
