  # a date assigned once testing is done.

  # A disable-flag is used when a worker needs to keep long-term backwards compatibility with one

  # Controls what happens when a Worker hosted on Cloudflare uses the global `fetch()` function to
  # request a hostname that is within the Worker's own Cloudflare zone (domain).
  #
  # Historically, such requests would be routed to the zone's origin server, ignoring any Workers
  # mapped to the URL and also bypassing Cloudflare security settings. This behavior made sense
  # when Workers was first introduced as a way to rewrite requests before passing them along to
  # the origin, and bindings didn't exist: the only way to forward the request to origin was to
  # use global fetch(), and if it didn't bypass Workers, you'd end up looping back to the same
  # Worker.
  #
  # However, this behavior has a problem: it opens the door for SSRF attacks. Imagine a Worker is
  # designed to fetch a resource from a user-provided URL. An attacker could provide a URL that
  # points back to the Worker's own zone, and possibly cause the Worker to fetch a resource from
  # origin that isn't meant to be reachable by the public.
  #
  # Traditionally, this kind of attack is considered a bug in the application: an application that
  # fetches untrusted URLs must verify that the URL doesn't refer to a private resource that only
  # the application itself is meant to access. However, applications can easily get this wrong.
  # Meanwhile, by using bindings, we can make this class of problem go away.
  #
  # When global_fetch_strictly_public is enabled, the global `fetch()` function (when invoked on
  # Cloudflare Workers) will strictly route requests as if they were made on the public internet.
  # Thus, requests to a Worker's own zone will loop back to the "front door" of Cloudflare and
  # will be treated like a request from the internet, possibly even looping back to the same Worker
  # again. If an application wishes to send requests to its origin, it must configure an "origin
  # binding". An origin binding behaves like a service binding (it has a `fetch()` method) but
  # sends requests to the zone's origin servers, bypassing Cloudflare. E.g. the Worker would write
  # `env.ORIGIN.fetch(req)` to send a request to its origin.
  #
  # Note: This flag only impacts behavior on Cloudflare. It has no effect when using workerd.
  # Under workerd, the config file can control where global `fetch()` goes by configuring the
  # worker's `globalOutbound` implicit binding. By default, under workerd, global `fetch()` has
  # always been configured to accept publicly-routable internet hosts only; hostnames which map
  # to private IP addresses (as defined in e.g. RFC 1918) will be rejected. Thus, workerd has
  # always been SSRF-safe by default.

  # When using the original WritableStream implementation ("internal" streams), the

  # HTTP methods are expected to be upper-cased. Per the fetch spec, if the methods
  # is specified as `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `head`, or `options`, implementations
  # are expected to uppercase the method. All other method names would generally be
  # expected to throw as unrecognized (e.g. `patch` would be an error while `PATCH` is
