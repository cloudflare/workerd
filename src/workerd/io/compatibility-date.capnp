# Newest compatibility date that can safely be set using code compiled from this repo. Trying to
# run a Worker with a newer compatibility date than this will fail.
#
# This should be updated to the current date on a regular basis. The reason this exists is so that
# if you build an old version of the code and try to run a new Worker with it, you get an
# appropriate error, rather than have the code run with the wrong compatibility mode.
#
# Note that the production Cloudflare Workers upload API always accepts any date up to the current
# date regardless of this constant, on the assumption that Cloudflare is always running the latest
# version of the code. This constant is more to protect users who are self-hosting the runtime and
# could be running an older version.

struct CompatibilityFlags @0x8f8c1b68151b6cef {
  # Flags that change the basic behavior of the runtime API, especially for

  #
  # Note: At one time, this was called "FeatureFlags", and many places in the codebase still call
  #   it that. We could do a mass-rename but there's some tricky spots involving JSON
  #   communications with other systems... I'm leaving it for now.

  # Compatibility flag names which enable or disable this feature, overriding what the worker's
  # compatibility date would otherwise set.
  #
  # An enable-flag is used to enable the feature before it becomes the default, probably for
  # testing purposes. All features probably should have an enable-flag defined first, then get
  # a date assigned once testing is done.
  #
  # A disable-flag is used when a worker needs to keep long-term backwards compatibility with one
  # bug but doesn't want to hold back everything else. This is hopefully rare! Most features
  # should not have a disable-flag defined unless we get requests from customers.

  # All compatibility dates should start using the flag as enabled.
  # NOTE: This is almost NEVER what you actually want because you're most likely breaking back
  # compat. Note that workers uploaded with the flag will fail validation, so this will break
  # uploads for anyone still using the flag.
  #
  # However, this is useful in some cases where the back compat you're breaking is for
  # pre-release users who you've communicated this in advance to. Turning this on for a field
  # will also cause test failures in compatibility-date-test.c++ and validation-test.ekam-rule
  # because the default set of flags that are enabled changes from being the empty set to including
  # this flag (at some point presumably it also means you're removing the compat flags at some point
  # and you'll have to repeat this exercise).

  webSocketCompression @20 :Bool
