# This file contains trace helper structures. The Trace struct is deliberately not defined here –
# many files just need to have the span/tag definitions available. Since Trace contains interfaces,
# it also causes a large amount of code to be generated in the .capnp.h file, which affects header
# parsing overhead/compile times for every file that depends on the capnp file defining Trace.

# The value of a span tag.
