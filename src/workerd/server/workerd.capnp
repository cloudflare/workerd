# This file defines the schema for configuring the workerd runtime.
#
# A config file can be written as a `.capnp` file that imports this file and then defines a
# constant of type `Config`. Alternatively, various higher-level tooling (e.g. wrangler) may
# generate configs for you, outputting a binary Cap'n Proto file.
#
# To start a server with a config, do:
#
#     workerd serve my-config.capnp constantName
#
# You can also build a new self-contained binary which combines the `workerd` binary with your
# configuration and all your source code:
#
#     workerd compile my-config.capnp constantName -o my-server-bin
#
# This binary can then be run stand-alone.
#
# A common theme in this configuration is capability-based design. We generally like to avoid
# giving a Worker the ability to access external resources by name, since this makes it hard
# to see and restrict what each Worker can access. Instead, the default is that a Worker has
# access to no privileged resources at all, and you must explicitly declare "bindings" to give
# it access to specific resources. A binding gives the Worker a JavaScript API object that points
# to a specific resource. This means that by changing config alone, you can fully controll which
# resources an Worker connects to. (You can even disallow access to the public internet, although
# public internet access is granted by default.)
#
# This config format is fairly powerful, allowing you to do things like define a TLS-terminating
# reverse proxy server without using any actual JavaScript code. However, you should not be
# afraid to fall back to code for anything the config cannot express, as Workers are very fast
# to execute!

  # to refer to the services from elsewhere in this config file, as well as for logging and the
  # like. Services are not reachable until you configure some way to make them reachable, such
  # as via a Socket.
  #
  # If you do not define any service called "internet", one is defined implicitly, representing
  # the ability to access public internet servers. An explicit definition would look like:
  #
  #     ( name = "internet",
  #       network = (
  #         allow = ["public"],   # Allows connections to publicly-routable addresses only.
  #         tlsOptions = (trustBrowserCas = true)
  #       )

  #
  # The "internet" service backs the global `fetch()` function in a Worker, unless that Worker's
  # configuration specifies some other service using the `globalOutbound` setting.

  # rather than on the actual command line because for most use cases, managing these via the
  # config file is probably cleaner and easier than passing on the actual CLI.
  #
  # WARNING: Use at your own risk. V8 flags can have all sorts of wild effects including completely
  #   breaking everything. V8 flags also generally do not come with any guarantee of stability
  #   between V8 versions. Most users should not set any V8 flags.

  #
  # Examples:
  # - "*:80": Listen on port 80 on all local IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces.
  # - "1.2.3.4": Listen on the specific IPv4 address on the default port for the protocol.
  # - "1.2.3.4:80": Listen on the specific IPv4 address and port.
  # - "1234:5678::abcd": Listen on the specific IPv6 address on the default port for the protocol.
  # - "[1234:5678::abcd]:80": Listen on the specific IPv6 address and port.
  # - "unix:/path/to/socket": Listen on a Unix socket.
  # - "unix-abstract:name": On Linux, listen on the given "abstract" Unix socket name.
  # - "example.com:80": Perform a DNS lookup to determine the address, and then listen on it. If
  #     this resolves to multiple addresses, listen on all of them.
  #
  # (These are the formats supported by KJ's parseAddress().)

  # hostname, since it is only reachable through the proxy, but the requests forwarded to it will
  # keep the hostname that was on the original request.
  #
  # Note that this also implies that regardless of whether the original URL was http: or https:,
  # the request will be delivered to the target server using the protocol specified below. A

  # - "1.2.3.4": Connect to the given IPv4 address on the protocol's default port.
  # - "1.2.3.4:80": Connect to the given IPv4 address and port.
  # - "1234:5678::abcd": Connect to the given IPv6 address on the protocol's default port.
  # - "[1234:5678::abcd]:80": Connect to the given IPv6 address and port.
  # - "unix:/path/to/socket": Connect to the given Unix Domain socket by path.
  # - "unix-abstract:name": On Linux, connect to the given "abstract" Unix socket name.
  # - "example.com:80": Perform a DNS lookup to determine the address, and then connect to it.

struct Network {
  # Describes the ability to talk to a network.
  #
  # This is commonly used to define the "internet" service which is the default `globalOutbound`
  # for all Workers. To prevent SSRF, by default Workers will not be permitted to reach internal
  # network addresses using global fetch(). It's recommended that you create ExternalServer
  # bindings instead to grant access to specific servers. However, if you really want to, you
  # can configure a service that grants arbitrary internal network access, like:
  #
  #     ( name = "internalNetwork",
  #       network = (
  #         allow = ["public", "private"],
  #       )
  #     )

  allow @0 :List(Text) = ["public"];
  deny @1 :List(Text);
  # Specifies which network addresses the Worker will be allowed to connect to, e.g. using fetch().
  # The default allows publicly-routable IP addresses only, in order to prevent SSRF attacks.
  #
  # The allow and deny lists specify network blocks in CIDR notation (IPv4 and IPv6), such as
  # "192.0.2.0/24" or "2001:db8::/32". Traffic will be permitted as long as the address
  # matches at least one entry in the allow list and none in the deny list.
  #
  # In addition to IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR notation, several special strings may be specified:
  # - "private": Matches network addresses that are reserved by standards for private networks,
  #   such as "10.0.0.0/8" or "192.168.0.0/16". This is a superset of "local".
  # - "public": Opposite of "private".
  # - "local": Matches network addresses that are defined by standards to only be accessible from
  #   the local machine, such as "127.0.0.0/8" or Unix domain addresses.
  # - "network": Opposite of "local".
  # - "unix": Matches all Unix domain socket addresses. (In the future, we may support specifying a
  #   glob to narrow this to specific paths.)
  # - "unix-abstract": Matches Linux's "abstract unix domain" addresses. (In the future, we may
  #   support specifying a glob.)
  #
  # In the case that the Worker specifies a DNS hostname rather than a raw address, these rules are
  # used to filter the addresses returned by the lookup. If none of the returned addresses turn
  # out to be permitted, then the system will behave as if the DNS entry did not exist.
  #
  # (The above is exactly the format supported by kj::Network::restrictPeers().)

  # interface to the directory content.
  #
  # This is very bare-bones, generally not suitable for serving a web site on its own. In
  # particular, no attempt is made to guess the `Content-Type` header. You normally would wrap
  # this in a Worker that fills in the metadata in the way you want.
  #
  # A GET request targetting a directory (rather than a file) will return a basic JSAN directory
  # listing like:
  #

  #
  # Possible "type" values are "file", "directory", "symlink", "blockDevice", "characterDevice",
  # "namedPipe", "socket", "other".
  #
  # `Content-Type` will be `application/octet-stream` for files or `application/json` for a
  # directory listing. Files will have a `Content-Length` header, directories will not. Symlinks
  # will be followed (but there is intentionally no way to create one, even if `writable` is
  # `true`), and treated according to the type of file they point to. The other inode types cannot
  # be opened; trying to do so will produce a "406 Not Acceptable" error (on the theory that there
  # is no acceptable format for these, regardless of what the client says it accepts).

  # NOT relative to the config file. So, you should usually use absolute paths in the config file.

  # Whether to support PUT requests for writing. A PUT will write to a temporary file which
  # is atomically moved into place upon successful completion of the upload. Parent directories are
  # created as needed.

  # Whether to allow access to files and directories whose name starts with '.'. These are made
  # inaccessible by default since they very often store metadata that is not meant to be served,
  # e.g. a git repository or an `.htaccess` file.
  #
  # Note that the special links "." and ".." will never be accessible regardless of this setting.
