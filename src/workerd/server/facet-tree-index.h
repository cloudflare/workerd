// Implements an index, stored on disk, which maps leaves of a tree to small integers in a stable
// way.
//
// Specifically, this is used to assign numeric IDs to facets of Durable Objects. Each Durable
// Object is potentially composed of a tree of "facets". One facet -- with ID zero -- serves as
// the root facet. All other facets have a parent facet and a name. Names are unique among facets
// with the same parent, but not globally. Each facet is assigned a numeric ID the first time it is
// seen. These IDs are assigned sequentially.
//
// We assume that the total number of facets created for a single Durable Object over its entire
// lifetime will never be very large. Therefore, it is reasonable to store the entire tree index
// in memory, loaded in its entirely at startup. Because of this, entries can simply be stored in
// order by ID (starting with ID 1, since no entry is needed for the root). We also assume that
// it's never necessary to delete an entry -- while a facet itself can be deleted, if a new facet
// is created with the same name, it should use the same ID. Therefore, the index file can be
// append-only, modified only when a never-before-seen facet is created.
//
// The facet index file therefore uses a very simple format. The index is simply a sequence of
// entries, where each entry is composed of:
// * A 2-byte integer specifying the parent ID.
// * A 2-byte integer specifying the length of the name. Note this cannot be zero.
// * The bytes of the name itself (not including any NUL terminator).
//
// Note that the format implicitly limits a Durable Object to have no more than 65536 facets in
// its entire lifetime. An attempt to exceed this limit will throw an exception. If this ever comes
// up in practice, we probably need to rethink the format -- not just the size of the integers, but
// the entire design, as it is not designed for so many facets.
//
// Notice that the index file's design is such that updating the file strictly at append operation.
// This avoids the need for a write-ahead log on updates. It is still possible, in the event of
// a power failure during an update, that the tail of the index will be corrupted. This is OK,
// becaues that tail could not have been relied upon yet. When reading the file, if a nonsensical
// entry is seen (parent ID out-of-range, name overrunning the end of the file, empty name, or
// duplicate entry), the remainder of the file from that point can simply be ignored. In the
// unlikely event that corrupted entries by coincidence appear to be valid, no harm is done -- this
// only has the effect of assigning IDs to names that will never actually be used.
//
// The index file is prefixed with the 8-byte magic number 0xc4cdce5bc5b0ef57. All integers
// (including the magic number) are in host byte order (which is little-endian on all supported
// platforms).
