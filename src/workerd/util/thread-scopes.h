// This file contains several horrible hacks involving setting a thread-local value within some
// scope in the call stack, and then being able to check the value from deeper in the stack,
// without passing down an object. We use this pattern to signal hints across modules that do not
// directly call each other, where it would be excessively inconvenient to pass the value down the
// stack, perhaps because there is code in between that we do not control (e.g., V8).
//
// This is an anti-pattern and these should be considered HORRIBLE HACKS... but they get their jobs
// done for the time being.
