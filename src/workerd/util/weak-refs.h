// try to obtain a strong reference of the underlying object. This is because the Object's
// destructor will explicitly clear the underlying pointer that would be dereferenced by
// `tryAddStrongRef`. This means that after the refcount reaches 0, `tryAddStrongRef` is always
// still safe to invoke even if the underlying object memory has been deallocated (provided
// ownership of the weak object reference is retained).
