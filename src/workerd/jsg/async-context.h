class AsyncContextFrame: public Wrappable {
  // Provides for basic internal async context tracking. Eventually, it is expected that
  // this will be provided by V8 assuming that the AsyncContext proposal advances through
  // TC-39. For now, however, we implement a model that is similar but not quite identical
  // to that implemented by Node.js.
  //
  // At any point in time when JavaScript is running, there is a current "Async Context Frame",
  // within which any number of "async resources" can be created. The term "resource" here
  // comes from Node.js (which really doesn't take the time to define it properly). Conceptually,
  // an "async resource" is some Thing that generates asynchronous activity over time (either
  // once or repeatedly). For instance, a timer is an async resource that invokes a callback
  // after a certain period of time elapses; a promise is an async resource that may trigger
  // scheduling of a microtask at some point in the future, and so forth. Whether or not
  // "resource" is the best term to use to describe these, it's what we have because our
  // intent here is to stay aligned with Node.js' model as closely as possible.
  //
  // Every async resource maintains a reference to the Async Context Frame that was current
  // at the moment the resource is created.
  //
  // Frames form a stack. The default frame is the Root. We "enter" a frame by pushing it
  // onto to top of the stack (making it "current"), then perform some action within that
  // frame, then "exit" by popping it back off the stack. The Root is associated with the
  // Isolate itself such that every isolate always has at least one frame on the stack at
  // all times. In Node.js terms, the "Async Context Frame" would be most closely aligned
  // with the concept of an "execution context" or "execution scope".
  //
  // Every Frame has a storage context. The current frame determines the currently active
  // storage context. So, for instance, when we start executing, the Root Frame's storage
  // context is active. When a timeout elapses and a timer is going to fire, we enter the
  // timer's Frame which makes that frame's storage context active. Once the timer
  // callback has completed, we return back to the Root frame and storage context.
  //
  // All frames (except for the Root) are created within the scope of a parent, which by
  // default is whichever frame is current when the new frame is created. When the new frame
  // is created, it inherits a copy storage context of the parent.
  //
  // AsyncContextFrame's are Wrappables because for certain kinds of async resources
  // like promises or JS functions, we have to be able to store a reference to the frame
  // using an opaque private property rather than an internal field or lambda capture.
  // In such cases, we attach an opaque JS wrapper to the frame and use that opaque
  // wrapper to hold the frame reference.

    // must call reset to signal that this StorageKey is "dead" and can never be
    // looked up again. Subsequent accesses to a frame will remove dead keys from
    // the frame lazily. The lazy cleanup does mean that values may persist in
    // memory a bit longer so if it proves to be problematic we can make the cleanup
    // a bit more proactive.

    // TODO(later): We should also evaluate the relatively unlikely case where an
    // ALS is capturing a reference to itself and therefore can never be cleaned up.
