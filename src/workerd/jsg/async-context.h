// Provides for basic internal async context tracking. Eventually, it is expected that
// this will be provided by V8 assuming that the AsyncContext proposal advances through
// TC-39. For now, however, we implement a model that is similar but not quite identical
// to that implemented by Node.js.
//
// At any point in time when JavaScript is running, there is a current "Async Context Frame",
// within which any number of "async resources" can be created. The term "resource" here
// comes from Node.js (which really doesn't take the time to define it properly). Conceptually,
// an "async resource" is some Thing that generates asynchronous activity over time (either
// once or repeatedly). For instance, a timer is an async resource that invokes a callback
// after a certain period of time elapses; a promise is an async resource that may trigger
// scheduling of a microtask at some point in the future, and so forth. Whether or not
// "resource" is the best term to use to describe these, it's what we have because our
// intent here is to stay aligned with Node.js' model as closely as possible.
//
// Every async resource maintains a reference to the Async Context Frame that was current
// at the moment the resource is created.
//
// Frames form a logical stack. The default frame is the Root. We "enter" a frame by pushing
// it onto to top of the stack (making it "current"), then perform some action within that
// frame, then "exit" by popping it back off the stack. The Root is associated with the
// Isolate itself such that every isolate always has at least one frame logically on the stack
// at all times. In Node.js terms, the "Async Context Frame" would be most closely aligned
// with the concept of an "execution context" or "execution scope".
//
// Every Frame has a storage context. The current frame determines the currently active
// storage context. So, for instance, when we start executing, the Root Frame's storage
// context is active. When a timeout elapses and a timer is going to fire, we enter the
// timer's Frame which makes that frame's storage context active. Once the timer
// callback has completed, we return back to the Root frame and storage context.
//
// All frames (except for the Root) are created within the scope of a parent, which by
// default is whichever frame is current when the new frame is created. When the new frame
// is created, it inherits a copy storage context of the parent.
//
// To implement all of this, however, we depend largely on an obscure v8 API on the
// v8::Context object called SetContinuationPreservedEmbedderData and
// GetContinuationPreservedEmbedderData. An AsyncContextFrame is a Wrappable because
// because instances of AsyncContextFrame are set as the continuation-preserved embedder
// data and that API requires a JS value.
//
// AsyncContextFrame::current() returns the current frame or nullptr. Returning nullptr
// implies that we are in the "root" frame.
//
// AsyncContextFrame::StorageScope is created on stack to create a new frame and set
// a stored value in the storage context before entering it.
//
// AsyncContextFrame::Scope is created on the stack to temporarily enter an existing
// frame.
//
// AsyncContextFrame::StorageKey is used to define a storage cell within the storage
// context.

    // The StorageKey is typically owned by an instance of AsyncLocalStorage (see
    // the api/node/async-hooks.h). When the ALS instance is garbage collected, it
    // must call reset to signal that this StorageKey is "dead" and can never be
    // looked up again. Subsequent accesses to a frame will remove dead keys from
    // the frame lazily. The lazy cleanup does mean that values may persist in
    // memory a bit longer so if it proves to be problematic we can make the cleanup
    // a bit more proactive.
