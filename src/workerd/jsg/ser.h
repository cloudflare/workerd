// Wraps the v8::ValueSerializer and v8::ValueSerializer::Delegate implementation.
// Must be allocated on the stack, and requires that a v8::HandleScope exist in
// the stack.
//
// To declare a JSG_RESOURCE_TYPE as serializeable, you must declare two special methods
// `serialize()` and `deserialize()`, and also use the JSG_SERIALIZABLE macro, which must appear
// after the `JSG_RESOURCE_TYPE` block (NOT inside it). Example:
//
//     class Foo: public jsg::Object {
//     public:
//       // ...
//
//       JSG_RESOURCE_TYPE(Foo) {
//         // ...
//       }
//
//       void serialize(jsg::Lock& js, jsg::Serializer& serializer);
//       static jsg::Ref<Foo> deserialize(Lock& js, MyTag tag, Deserializer& deserializer);
//       JSG_SERIALIZABLE(MyTag::FOO_V2, MyTag::FOO_V1);
//
//       // ...
//     };
//
// * `MyTag` is some enum type declared in the application which enumerates all known serializeable
//   types. This can be any enum, but it is suggested that all types in the application use the
//   same enum type, and the numeric values of the tags must never change. A Cap'n Proto enum is
//   suggested.
// * `JSG_SERIALIZABLE`'s parameters are a list of tags that encode this type. There may be more
//   than one tag listed to support versioning. The first tag listed is the current version, which
//   is the format that `serialize()` will write. The other tags are non-current versions that
//   `deserialize()` accepts in addition to the current version. These are usually old versions,
//   but could also include a new version that hasn't fully rolled out yet -- it will be necessary
//   to fully roll out support for parsing a new version before anyone can start generating it.
// * The serialization system automatically handles writing and reading the tag values before
//   calling the methods.
// * serialize() makes a series of calls to serializer.write*() methods to write the content of the
//   object.
// * deserialize() makes a corresponding series of calls to deserializer.read*() methods to read
//   the object. These must be the exact corresponding calls in the same order as serialize()
//   would have made them. The sequence can never change once data has been written for a given
//   tag version; the only way to change is to define a new version.
// * Both `serialize()` and `deserialize()` can take additional arguments of the form
//   `const jsg::TypeHandler<SomeType>&`, which will automatically be filled in with the
//   corresponding type handler. This is useful if the serializer wants to, say, assemble a
//   JSG_STRUCT, convert it into an actual JS object, and serialize that.

  // A `Serializer` instance may have an `ExternalHandler` which can be used when serializing

    //   possible, since the serialization wouldn't actually capture the Proxy logic? But I'm
