// The entrypoint to a worker has to be an ES6 module (well, ignoring service
// workers). For Python workers, we use this file as the ES6 entrypoint.
//
// This file is treated as part of the user bundle and cannot import internal
// modules. Any imports from this file must be user-visible. To deal with this,
// we delegate the implementation to `python-entrypoint-helper` which is a
// BUILTIN module that can see our INTERNAL modules.
