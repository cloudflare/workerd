// This is the Edge Chat Demo Worker, built using Durable Objects!

// ===============================
// Introduction to Modules
// ===============================
//
// The first thing you might notice, if you are familiar with the Workers platform, is that this
// Worker is written differently from others you may have seen. It even has a different file
// extension. The `mjs` extension means this JavaScript is an ES Module, which, among other things,
// means it has imports and exports. Unlike other Workers, this code doesn't use
// `addEventListener("fetch", handler)` to register its main HTTP handler; instead, it _exports_
// a handler, as we'll see below.
//
// This is a new way of writing Workers that we expect to introduce more broadly in the future. We
// like this syntax because it is *composable*: You can take two workers written this way and
// merge them into one worker, by importing the two Workers' exported handlers yourself, and then
// exporting a new handler that call into the other Workers as appropriate.
//
// This new syntax is required when using Durable Objects, because your Durable Objects are
// implemented by classes, and those classes need to be exported. The new syntax can be used for
// writing regular Workers (without Durable Objects) too, but for now, you must be in the Durable
// Objects beta to be able to use the new syntax, while we work out the quirks.
//
// To see an example configuration for uploading module-based Workers, check out the wrangler.toml
// file or one of our Durable Object templates for Wrangler:
//   * https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-template
//   * https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-rollup-esm
//   * https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-webpack-commonjs

// ===============================
// Required Environment
// ===============================
//
// This worker, when deployed, must be configured with two environment bindings:
// * rooms: A Durable Object namespace binding mapped to the ChatRoom class.
// * limiters: A Durable Object namespace binding mapped to the RateLimiter class.
//
// Incidentally, in pre-modules Workers syntax, "bindings" (like KV bindings, secrets, etc.)
// appeared in your script as global variables, but in the new modules syntax, this is no longer
// the case. Instead, bindings are now delivered in an "environment object" when an event handler
// (or Durable Object class constructor) is called. Look for the variable `env` below.
//
// We made this change, again, for composability: The global scope is global, but if you want to
// call into existing code that has different environment requirements, then you need to be able
// to pass the environment as a parameter instead.
//
// Once again, see the wrangler.toml file to understand how the environment is configured.

// =======================================================================================
// The regular Worker part...
//
// This section of the code implements a normal Worker that receives HTTP requests from external
// clients. This part is stateless.

// With the introduction of modules, we're experimenting with allowing text/data blobs to be
// uploaded and exposed as synthetic modules. In wrangler.toml we specify a rule that files ending
// in .html should be uploaded as "Data", equivalent to content-type `application/octet-stream`.
// So when we import it as `HTML` here, we get the HTML content as an `ArrayBuffer`. This lets us
// serve our app's static asset without relying on any separate storage. (However, the space
// available for assets served this way is very limited; larger sites should continue to use Workers
// KV to serve assets.)
import HTML from "./chat.html";

// `handleErrors()` is a little utility function that can wrap an HTTP request handler in a
// try/catch and return errors to the client. You probably wouldn't want to use this in production
// code but it is convenient when debugging and iterating.
async function handleErrors(request, func) {
  try {
    return await func();
  } catch (err) {
    if (request.headers.get("Upgrade") == "websocket") {
      // Annoyingly, if we return an HTTP error in response to a WebSocket request, Chrome devtools
      // won't show us the response body! So... let's send a WebSocket response with an error
      // frame instead.
      let pair = new WebSocketPair();
      pair[1].accept();
      pair[1].send(JSON.stringify({error: err.stack}));
      pair[1].close(1011, "Uncaught exception during session setup");

    } else {
      return new Response(err.stack, {status: 500});
    }
  }
}

// In modules-syntax workers, we use `export default` to export our script's main event handlers.
// Here, we export one handler, `fetch`, for receiving HTTP requests. In pre-modules workers, the
// fetch handler was registered using `addEventHandler("fetch", event => { ... })`; this is just
// new syntax for essentially the same thing.
//
// `fetch` isn't the only handler. If your worker runs on a Cron schedule, it will receive calls
// to a handler named `scheduled`, which should be exported here in a similar way. We will be
// adding other handlers for other types of events over time.
